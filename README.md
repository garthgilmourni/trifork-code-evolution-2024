# Sample projects for Trifork Code Evolution 2024

This repository contains three sample projects, used to demostrate the [JetBrains AI Assistant](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/) at [Trifork Code Evolution 2024](https://trifork.info/code-evolution-2024). The projects are completely independent.

The details of the projects are as follows:

* The `regex-sample` project contains a mystery function called `g`, which mimics the [UNIX grep command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep). We want to see if the AI Assistant can recognise this function and suggest useful refactorings.
* The `photography-sample` project contains a mystery function called `ev` , which calculates the [Exposure Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value) used in photogrpahy. We want to see if the AI Assistant can explain the problem domain to us, refactor the function, suggest testing scenarios and then create a JUnit test.
* The `ktor-tasks-ai` project contains a sample Ktor service that acts as a Task Manager. We want to see if the AI Assistant can add support for POST and DELETE requests, and generate the corresponding test methods using the Ktor Testing Library.
